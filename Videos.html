                                <h3>Ramon's &amp; Jerry's Story</h3>
                                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>Ramon's humble beggining and want to provide for his family is what brought him over to Effulgent Leads. He didn't let his lack of tech knowledge and his age be a hindering factor in his success. As a expert in his field he felt that he could provide a service that could stand out from the competition. We always like to work with small business and enjoyed the passion and energy he brought to the table, don't let anything stop you from reaching your dreams. He always did what needed to be done in order to provide for his family. So what's your excuse? Why haven't you started that business or took that risk that you wanted to take so badly? He hopes to inspire his daughter and his children alike start business of their own and hopes that his family carries on his entrepeanurial ventures.</p>
                                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span>Jerry's Story all began with him being knees deep in work. This is where we came in and provided a solution for good old jear bear. He told us how he had so many issues with turnover and hiring and having people stay with his company was such a pain. We helped to create a training calendar for his staff, Interviewing process to make sure we got people that were the right fit. We even helped to create training videos as his company and operation was growing and he saw the need to scale and have more people on his team. Now he has more free time and is focused less on working inside the businees and more outside of it and helping to make it grow and reach potential new clients everyday. Our <b>Email Marketing</b> was a game changer for jerry as we were able to regain old customers and even find a new fanbase for him.</p>
